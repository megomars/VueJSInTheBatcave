#Vue.js in the batcave

##Vue.js is a progressive and component-oriented Javascript framework for building user interfaces.

Vue allows us to separate our view from our data and is used for building single page apps.

The following are generally considered bad practice:
1. Storing/reading data in the DOM
2. Updating the DOM using direct DOM manipulation and modification rather than template rendering
3. Using procedural methods to evaluate state in disjointed ways that often lead to a DOM representation that doesnâ€™t match the intended state
